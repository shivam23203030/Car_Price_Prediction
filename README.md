# Car_Price_Prediction
This project uses machine learning to predict prices of used cars based on features such as make, model, year, mileage, engine type, and more. Leveraging a historical car sales dataset, it provides valuable insights and price estimates, helping buyers and sellers evaluate a vehicle's market value effectively.
